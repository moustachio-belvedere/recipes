Ingredients
- 300ml double cream
- 1/2 - 2/3 (generous half) cup of icing sugar
- teaspoon vanilla essence
- 5 tablespoons rum (or more)
- 2 egg yolks

Method
- beat the cream until 'soft peaks' show
- In a separate container:
    . beat the rest of the ingredients until 'saucy'
- gently add the separate mix to the cream, beat slowly

Don't worry about washing any implements, doesn't matter
if the two parts mix a little before the main combination.
