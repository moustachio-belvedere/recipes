250g plain white flour
150ml whole milk
4 free-range eggs, beaten
2 tbsp beef dripping or sunflower oil

1. Sift the flour into a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt. Combine the milk in a jug with 150ml cold water.

2. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs. Pour in a little milk and water, and then whisk the lot together to make a smooth batter. Mix in the rest of the liquid, until you have a batter the consistency of single cream. Leave at room temperature for at least 15 minutes.

3. Once the meat has come out of the oven, turn the temperature up to 230C (ensuring any potatoes that might be lurking in there aren't going to burn in the following half hour). Put a large roasting tin, or a 12-hole muffin tin, greased liberally with dripping or oil, on a high shelf and leave for 10 minutes to heat up.

4. Take the tin out of the oven, and keep warm on the hob if possible while you ladle in the batter – if it doesn't sizzle when you add the first spoonful, put the tin back into the oven until it does.

5. Put the puddings into the oven and cook for 15–20 minutes until well risen and golden. Keep an eye on them towards the end of the cooking time, but do not be tempted to open the door until they're beautifully bronzed, because they'll sink.

6. Eat immediately.

## Notes

Original recipe says: "Makes 1 large, or 12 individual puddings". We found that 1.5x recipe quantities made 24 puddings (but perhaps the tin was closer to cupcake size than muffin size...)

Use just enough sunflower oil to cover each base then fill each halfway with batter when hot.
