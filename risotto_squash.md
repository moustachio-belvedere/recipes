## Ingredients
- 300g risotto rice to ~1kg squash
- olive oil
- salt, pepper

## Method
1. Roast squash with oil, salt pepper.
2. Add saffron strands to slightly cooled stock (half chicken, half vegetable) and let it diffuse before adding to rice.
3. Standard risotto technique from here onwards.

## Notes
Scaled up to 1.5x, i.e. 450g rice, this recipe uses almost exactly 2 litres of stock.

Rest of the ingredients are flexible. For the scaled up version, generally use ~ 2 onions and generous amount of garlic.
