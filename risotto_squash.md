300g risotto rice to ~1kg squash (roasted with olive oil, salt, pepper).

Add Saffron to slightly cooled stock (half chicken, half vegetable) and let it diffuse before adding.

Scaled up to 1.5x, this recipe uses almost exactly 2 litres of stock.

Rest of the ingredients are flexible. For the scaled up version, generally use ~ 2 onions and generous amount of garlic.
