## Ingredients
see yorkshire_puddings.md

## Method
Sunflower oil + 12 chipolatas cooked at ~200C for ~15 minutes until a little browned.

Turned up oven a little, poured in batter, cooked for about 25 mins.

## Notes
Will try 3/4 of yorkshire quantities next time as there was unused batter and the main bake could have used less as well (we had the batter almost covering the sausage, but about halfway up may have been better).
