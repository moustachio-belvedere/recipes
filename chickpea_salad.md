250g Bulgur Wheat
700g Chickpeas (in their stock, usually 1x big jar, proper garbanzos, ~500g drained weight)
(optional) 1x chicken stock cube

Pour all cickpeas with their stock into pan, add all bulgur wheat and break up chicken stock.

Add some boiled water and bring to boil.

Let simmer. Don't put too much water in as we don't want to drain off any of the good flavours
from the chickpea stock.

Serve with any fresh veg, meat and cheese as desired.

(Nice with chopped lettuce, tomatos, olives, goats cheese, feta, etc.)
